# PyBer_Analysis.
## Overview of the analysis:
 We analyze weekly fares for three types of ride-sharing data: rural, suburban, and urban by using Python, Panda ,matplotlib skills to prepare a report with a data frame and line-chart. It helps stakeholder having better overview of those differences and coming out a plan to improve business mode at PyBer. 
 
## Results: 
![Summary_DataFrame](https://github.com/WeiTing83/PyBer_Analysis./blob/main/Resources/Summary_DataFrame.png)

  * At Urban, there are more population and higher market demand so it is more competitive.
  * At Rural, total rides is one and half times larger than total drivers. There isn’t every ride has a customer.

  * At 2/24, there are higher fares at rural and suburban. It probably has some reasons cause customers need to take a ride. We should collect more data to further analyze it.

## Summary: 

#### At Urban and suburban city:
* An neighberhood app for carpool gets lower competitive price.
* Coordinate with company to attract more new customers.
#### At Rural: 
* A resevation system
* Reduce the full-time drivers and invite more part-time drivers.    
        
The total fares at urban and suburban cities are over 13 times higher than rural city. Apparently, there is more demand in the big cities than rural city but the average fare for each driver in the countryside is higher than the big cities, especially when compared to the urban city. To resolve these disparities, we would like to provides three business recommendations to the CEO of PyBer.

First of all, we can introduce a neighborhood app for ride-sharing to attract more customers if they want to get lower fares. In addition, we also can collaborate with some big companies to introduce more new customers. For example, we can make an energy saving project to encourage them to join this ride-sharing program. It can help them save energy in traffic and be more productive at work.

At Rural, I noticed there aren’t every ride has enough customers. Total rides are 1.5 times higher than drivers. That means the drivers go out each time ,but it was around 38% no customer0s. It may lead higher cost. In order to reduce cost, we can establish a reservation system to make sure each ride has enough customers. Additionally, we also can hire more part-time drivers to meet market demands.
